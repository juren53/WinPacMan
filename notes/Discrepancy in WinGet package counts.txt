Discrepancy in WinGet package counts.txt

The discrepancy in the WinGet package count (4315 packages in WPM vs. ~9000 reported by WinGet) can be attributed
  to the following:

   1. WinGet.run API Limitation: WPM currently uses the winget.run third-party API (via WinGetRunFetcher) to fetch available WinGet
      packages. It appears this API, despite its pagination attempts, is only returning a subset of the total WinGet package
      inventory. The 4315 packages likely represent the full extent of what this specific API is providing at the moment.
   2. `winget.exe` Version: Your current winget.exe version (v1.12.350) does not support structured output formats like JSON for its
      search command. This prevents us from reliably running winget search directly and parsing its output to get the full ~9000
      packages. The direct CLI output can be inconsistent or interactive, making programmatic parsing difficult.

  In summary: The winget.run API is currently the bottleneck for getting the complete WinGet package list into WPM's cache. While
  we've enabled a full refresh using this API, its current output limits the total number of packages fetched.

  Potential Future Solutions:
   * Upgrade `winget.exe`: If a newer version of winget.exe supporting JSON output for search becomes available, we could switch to
     using that for a more comprehensive and direct package list.
   * Alternative API/Source: Investigate if other WinGet APIs or methods (e.g., winget source export) provide more complete and
     parseable data.

  For now, the 4315 packages represent the maximum that can be reliably fetched via the current winget.run API integration.
