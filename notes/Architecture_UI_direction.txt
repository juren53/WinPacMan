Architecture Decisions (Updated 2025-12-26):

Architecture:
✅ Strategy Pattern implemented for package managers (PackageManagerService)
✅ Configuration management: JSON settings with XDG compliance (SettingsService)
✅ Threading: QThread-based workers with pyqtSignal for non-blocking operations
✅ Layered architecture: Presentation (UI) -> Service -> Core -> Infrastructure

UI/UX:
✅ Phase 1-2 Complete: Standard PyQt6 widgets with custom stylesheets
✅ Modern styling using Qt CSS (Windows 11 inspired blue accents)
❌ PyQt-Fluent-Widgets abandoned due to PyQt5/PyQt6 incompatibility
✅ Color-coded package table (green=WinGet, orange=Choco, blue=Pip, pink=NPM)
⏳ Frameless window design: Deferred to Phase 4 (polish)

Next Steps:
- Phase 2: Complete manual testing (12 tests in MANUAL_TEST_GUIDE.md)
- Phase 3: Implement Install/Uninstall operations
- Phase 4: Search functionality and settings page
